Unit Tests: 

multiplication(1,0) should return 0. 
multiplication(5,10) should return 50.
multiplication(1) should return an error since there are not enough arguments
multiplication("asdf") should return an error since it is not the correct arguments


concatOdds([3, 2, 1], [9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1]) ...should result in [-1, 1, 3, 9, 15]
concatOdds([9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1]) shold just return [-1,1,1,1,9,] since it will assume the second argument is null 
concatOdds([1,1],[3,4]) should return [1,1,3]
concatOdds([1,3],[3,4]) should return [1,3,3]
concatOdds("asdf",[1,2,3]) should return an error becuase it is an incorrect argument
concatOdds("asdf",true) should return an error becuase it is an incorrect argument
concatOdds([1,2],true) should return an error becuase it is an incorrect argument
concatOdds([1,2],1) should return an error becuase it is an incorrect argument


Functional Tests: 
A client should browse and select items. 
    - They should try checking out. If there are no items, it should not let them check out and let them know they need an item in the cart. 
A client should go to the computer and begin checking out 
    - upon checking out, they should be prompted to log in, or create an account.
    - there should also be a smaller option to check out as guest 
Once checking out, the client should check the cart contains the items that they selected in our first step. The total should also be displayed clearly. 
The client should not be able to advance without inputting a payment method
The client should be able to use Venmo, Paypal, or Stripe. 
The client should be able to get a confirmation receipt once they pay. 

The prompts of this feature miss and gloss over providing a correct credit card number or a correct billing address when using a credit card option since we do not have any checks currently in place.
